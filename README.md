# RC_Low_Pass_Filter_LTspice
RC Low-Pass Filter simulation project using LTspice. Shows frequency attenuation and -3dB cutoff behavior.
This project simulates a *Low Pass RC Filter* using *LTspice*. The purpose is to analyze frequency response and understand cutoff behavior.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- LTspice for circuit simulation
- Frequency sweep from 10 Hz to 1 MHz

## 📐 Circuit Configuration
- *R = 1kΩ*
- *C = 0.1μF*
- Cutoff Frequency (fc) ≈ 1.59 kHz  
  fc = 1 / (2πRC)

## 📊 Output
- Bode plot shows gain roll-off after fc
- Simulation confirms expected -3 dB point

## 📁 Files Included
- RC_LPF.asc – Schematic file
- RC_LPF_Simulation.png – Graph Screenshot
- README.md – This documentation
